# Cleaning cache and log files

- To clean all cache and log file, run the command `nyssa clean`.
- To clean log files only pass the `--logs` flag (or `-l` for short). For example, `nyssa clean --logs`
- To clean cache files only pass the `--cache` flag (or `-c` for short). For example, `nyssa clean --cache`.
- You can pass the `--all` flag (or `-a` for short) to clean everything. This is the same as simply running `nyssa clean`.
