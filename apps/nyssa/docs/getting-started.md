# Installing Nyssa

Nyssa comes prepackaged with all Blade versions since `v0.0.86` and needs no further installation action. You'll need to upgrade your Blade installation you are on a Blade version lower than `v0.0.86`.

The best way to enjoy the power of Nyssa is to add your Blade installation path to your shell/terminal environment. Various operating systems provides different mechanisms for adding a path to the environment so the steps may vary for your specific operating system.

Here's a few links for different operating systems showing how to do this.

You should see an output similar to the below.
