Blade is a simple, clean, and embeddable dynamic programming language created to be simple enough for beginners, yet powerful and expressive for professionals. It has a very small syntax set with a very low learning curve. Blade improves upon the best features of JavaScript, Python, and Ruby to give developers a familiar and powerful system that feels native for developers coming from any of these languages and an easy way to leverage the strength of any.

Blade also comes with [Nyssa](https://github.com/blade-lang/nyssa), the official package manager, which makes it easy to install and manage packages and modules.

## Features

- **First-class package management**: Package management is built into the language module system.
- **Iterable classes**: Blade has built-in support for iterable classes, making it easy to work with collections of data.
- **Backend development**: Blade can be used for backend development without any external dependencies.
- **Function promotion**: Blade allows for function promotion, making it easy to reuse any piece of code from an imported module.
- **Default exports and imports**: Blade supports default exports and imports, making it easy to organize code.
- **Anonymous functions**: Blade supports anonymous functions, making it easy to write functional code.
- **Access modifiers**: Unlike any of JavaScript, Python and Ruby, Blade supports access modifiers for variables, properties, functions, classes, modules, etc.
- **Decorator functions**: Blade supports decorator functions, making it easy to add functionality to existing code.
- **Function overrides**: Blade supports function overrides in classes, allowing a class to choose the result to return for a function if the function allows it.
- **Easy to extend with C modules**: Blade supports external extensions built in C, making it easy to extend the language with C modules.

## Use Cases

Blade can be used for a wide range of tasks, including:

- **Web development**: Blade can be used to create web applications and web services.
- **Data science**: Blade can be used to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- **Scripting**: Blade can be used to write scripts to automate tasks.
- And more...

## Showcase

- **[Nyssa](https://github.com/blade-lang/nyssa)**: The Nyssa self-hostable repository server and package manager is written in Blade.
- **[jsonrpc](https://github.com/mcfriend99/jsonrpc)**: A JSON-RPC library for Blade programming language.
- **[wire](https://github.com/mcfriend99/wire)**: Dynamic HTML template engine.
- **[tar](https://github.com/mcfriend99/tar)**: Pure Blade library for creating and extracting TAR archives.

## Example

The following code implements a simple backend API that runs on port 3000:

```js
import http
import json

var server = http.server(3000)
server.on_receive(@(request, response) {
  response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
  response.write(json.encode(request))
})

echo 'Listening on Port 3000...'
server.listen()
```

## How does it differ from Python and Ruby?

- First-class package management (Package management is built into the language module system).
- Iterable classes.
- Backend development without any external dependencies.
- [Function promotion](https://bladelang.com/tutorial/modules.html#function-promotion).
- Default exports and imports.
- Anonymous functions.
- Access modifiers for variables, properties, function, class, modules, etc.
- Decorator functions.
- Function overrides in classes &mdash; A class can chose the result to return for a function if the function allows it.
- Easy to extend with C modules with a familiar API to Wren.
